                            <h3>Derelict</h3>
                        </header>
                        <p>Derelict is the result of a 3-month effort by a team of four programmers and three artists at UMBC to develop a working demo for our senior games project.
                            As Lead Programmer, I was responsible for coordinating the programming team's efforts and serving as liaison to the Project Leader and art team.
                            I developed key features for the game, including procedural level-generation, artificial intelligence, dynamic lighting, and special effects.</p>
                        <p>This first-person stealth suspense game offers a modern take on the grays of classic alien abduction lore.
                            Security drones patrol the alien spacecraft, searching for the player, an abductee freed by the ship's crash landing.
                            The player must evade capture by staying in the shadows, keeping quiet, and strategically throwing broken pieces of ship equipment to distract pursuers.</p>
                        <p>Derelict was developed using agile/SCRUM methodologies in two-week sprints over the course of three months.
                            The team used Unity3D and C# for its production. User input and movement controls were handled by modified javascripts included in Unity's standard packages, and the artificial intelligence code extended the A* Pathfinding package.
                            The custom code base consisted of over 40 files and 4,500 lines.</p>
                        <p>As lead programmer, it was my job to propose candidate sprint goals, ensuring that every programmer had a task list appropriate to their availability, which appealed to their interests.
                            It was my responsibility to facilitate the success of each sprint by supporting the programmers and facilitating open communication with the art team.
                            I made sure that every programmer had the understanding, tools, and support needed to complete their tasks within the allotted period.
                            I also supported the team lead in prioritizing features, settling conflicts, and evaluating team progress after each sprint.</p>
                        <p>My technical contributions to the project ranged from procedural level-generation to artificial intelligence and special effects.
                            I developed a set of art pipeline standards to produce assets that could be assimilated seamlessly into a scalable and customizable procedural level-generation algorithm.
                            My code used parameters to constrain such variables as the number of enemies in each room, the range of hallway lengths, and the prevalence of throwable objects.
                            At the start of each level, the code loaded from the asset library rooms, hallway segments, drones, patrol waypoints, and throwable objects.
                            Hallway lighting, also procedurally generated, responded dynamically to the environment.
                            Collision testing was handled during level generation to ensure that levels were viable with respect to the asset placement.</p>
                        <p>My artificial intelligence code extended the A* Pathfinding package, and used navigation meshes produced through the art pipeline to guide pathfinding.
                            These navigation meshes were placed appropriately during level generation to match the placement of respective rooms and hallway segments.
                            The drones and aliens were equipped with both vision and hearing capabilities.
                            By default, they patrolled random waypoints within a set radius of their original position.
                            If they saw the player or heard a noise, the AI would investigate the source of disturbance.
                            When the disturbance was no longer detected, the AI would continue to the last place where the object or player was seen or heard before returning to its patrolling state.
                            If a drone spotted the player, it would set off an alarm, including sound effects and lighting.
                            Each alarm summoned an alien to the location of the triggered drone.
                            If the player managed to avoid detection, the alien would disable the alarm and patrol for a short distance before disappearing.
                            Both drones and aliens increased their speed when in pursuit, and slowed down when returning to their normal patrol routes.
                            The AI difficulty scaled by level, becoming smarter and faster as the game progressed.</p>
                        <p>I developed an extendable motion-sensor package for this game that activated doors and lights when the player or NPCs passed by.
                            The lights featured in the hallways of Derelict flickered randomly according to patterns set during procedural generation.
                            I modeled key characteristics such as broken motion sensors, tendency towards dim or bright lighting, and frequency and duration of flickers.
                            The motion sensors were customizable by precision and sensitivity, and included visual debugging tools.</p>
                        <p>Other technical contributions to the project included GUIs, debugging tools, teleporters, particle effects, a pulsing stamina overlay, and some player movement controls.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>In Penance, the protagonist relies on her halo to defeat demons and human henchmen. Gripping the halo triggers "angel mode" and enables a slashing melee attack, while throwing the halo triggers "demon mode" which makes the player vulnerable to demons and enables a free form ranged attack.
                            This was my very first game in Unity3D.</p>

                            <h3>3D Terrain Simulation</h3>
                        </header>
                        <p>This was a two-part graphics project in which I was given a simple program that uses OpenGL to render a
                            hilly terrain. I was later given a car model in OBJ format (including .obj and .mtl files). I extended the
                            base program to allow the user to drive interactively over the landscape in either first-person or third-
                            person view (toggled by key). The program reads the OBJ format files into arrays for each vertex and
                            normal, and draws the faces for each material separately to allow for change in colors. Barycentric
                            interpolation is used to calculate terrain elevation between vertices, adding an offset to bring the
                            vehicle above the terrain. The landscape is made effectively infinite by rendering eight extra offset
                            copies of the base terrain. Whenever the vehicle reaches the edge of the base terrain, it is moved back
                            to the opposite edge. This process is obscured by a fog. The user may accelerate forward or backward,
                            subject to air drag and a maximum velocity, and may rotate left or right. Mouse movement in first-
                            person mode allows the user to look around the vehicle from the driver&#39;s perspective. Mouse
                            movement in third-person mode allows the user to rotate around the car, with vertical rotation
                            restricted to 90 degrees above the terrain.</p>

                        <p>This model attempts to simulate a basic association map where nodes are initially unconnected. The
                            environment randomly inputs currents into the system, which are converted into impulses. Impulses
                            randomly form connections with other nodes. As connections begin to form and strengthen, they are
                            more likely to be reinforced than weaker connections. Connections made by neighbor nodes are then
                            more likely to be reinforced in turn as those nodes are visited with greater frequency.</p>
